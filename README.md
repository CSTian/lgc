# Learning with Local and Global Consistency

Learning with Local and Global Consistency(LGC) algorithm

The LGC algorithm was originally published in the following paper: Zhou, Denny, et al. "Learning with local and global consistency." Advances in neural information processing systems. 2004.

This is an implementation of LGC(Local and Global Consistency) in Python 3 using Jupyter Notebook tool to perform an experiment in a toy data.
